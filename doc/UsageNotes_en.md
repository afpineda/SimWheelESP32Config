# Usage notes

There are 6 tabs in the app. However, any configuration option not relevant to your device will not show up:

- "Devices" tab: device scanning and selection.
- "Clutch paddles" tab": configure the working mode of clutch paddles.
- "ALT buttons" tab: configure the working mode of "ALT" buttons.
- "Battery" tab: show state of charge. If your battery is not calibrated, you may request a battery auto-calibration.
- "Presets" tab: load/save all configuration options.
- "Buttons map" tab: customize button numbers.

If you change any configuration option through the device itself, select another tab for a refresh.

## "Devices" tab

- On start, suitable devices are automatically scanned. If only one is available, it is automatically selected.
- Hit "Scan" to re-scan available devices.
- Select a device in the list to connect.
- Incompatible devices will not show up.
  If that were your case, use an older version of this app or update your firmware.

## "Buttons map" tab

- Changes are **not** automatically saved.
- Click "Refresh" to download current map (may take a few seconds).
- Click "save" to make any change available after power off.
- Click "Defaults" to return to "factory defaults" (not saved).
- Button numbers are 0-based. For example, button #0 is the first button.
  Note that the following button numbers have a special meaning in Windows:
  - *00*: "A" button
  - *01*: "B" button
  - *02*: "X" button
  - *03*: "Y" button
  - *04*: "LB" button (should be reserved for the left shift paddle)
